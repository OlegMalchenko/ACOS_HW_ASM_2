# ACOS Workshops' solutions
Solutions of the ACOS Workshops' problems by O.Malchenko
## Notes on 3d WS
//The first and second tasks are skipped as trivial, since they only required to become used to basics of RISC-V assembler//

//Tasks have been done in order, presented on the DSBA ACOS course site//

//Each task (from 3rd to 11th) are presented in this repository in .asm extension//

//**No licencing**//

//In case of any questions, remarks, additions, please contact me via telegram//
## Notes on 4th WS
//**No licencing**//
## Notes on 5th WS
//In the second task the array has been implemented using stack (.space directive), elements are stored in memory in reverse order//

//In the third task exception for zero division was added//

//In the last task case 0^0 gives 1 (python-like explicit definition)//

//**No licencing**//
